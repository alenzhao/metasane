[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clemente-lab/metasane.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clemente-lab/metasane)

metasane is currently under active development and thus its API should be
considered highly unstable.

**Note:** The ```data``` directory contains ontologies and derived controlled
vocabularies from many open ontologies (e.g., ENVO, UBERON, etc.). The metasane
development team takes no credit in the creation of this work. Full credit goes
to the respective ontology authors.
